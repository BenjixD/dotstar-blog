Usage Guide
-----------
Compilation: 
	- Run ./node_modules/.bin/webpack --watch
Modifying Server and Client files are watched by webpack and automatically generated when modified.


Running Server:
	- Run nodemon command on the build file PATH/src/server/build/app.backend.js
app.backend.js is the webpack compiled server entry point. (Configuration mirrors that of grunt).


Rendering Front End Builds:
	- Render builds in HTML via <script/> for files PATH/src/client/build/.*
Webpack automatically rebuilds html files when jsx files are changed. (Note: Babel loader transcribes ES8, JSX to browser readable content).


Adding new Front End Builds:
	- New pages should be added to PATH/webpack.config.js under the frontend config.
	- Add as an entry point in the array list with a unique key
Each entry point defines a new webpage that utilizes new React Components 


Adding Loaders and Plugins:
	- Plugins and loaders common to both front end and backend should be appended to the array list inside the common config.
Ensure to install and save to package.json any loaders used in webpack.
